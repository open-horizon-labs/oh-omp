Manages a phased task list. Submit an `ops` array — each op mutates state incrementally.
**Primary op: `update`.** Use it to mark tasks `in_progress` or `completed`. Only reach for other ops when the structure itself needs to change.

Use a list when it helps maintain continuity across substantial work or when the user requests one. Step count alone does not require tracking; direct execution is fine.

Keep an existing list accurate at meaningful milestones. Batch related updates in one call; no before/after call quota or rigid phase sequence is required. The tool retains one active task while unfinished work remains and none when everything is completed or abandoned.

<protocol>
## Operations

|op|When to use|
|---|---|
|`update`|Mark a task in_progress / completed / abandoned, or edit content/notes|
|`replace`|Initial setup, or full restructure when the plan changes significantly|
|`add_phase`|Add a new phase of work discovered mid-task|
|`add_task`|Add a task to an existing phase|
|`remove_task`|Remove a task that is no longer relevant|

## Statuses

|Status|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`pending`|Not started|
|`in_progress`|Current focus — the tool retains at most one|
|`completed`|Fully done|
|`abandoned`|Dropped intentionally|

## Updating progress
- Mark work completed only when it is actually done, and abandoned when intentionally dropped.
- Record blockers in notes or as a separate task when useful.
- Tasks may finish out of phase order; report actual progress rather than forcing it into a sequence.
- Multiple ops can be batched in one call (e.g., complete current + start next).
</protocol>

## Task Anatomy
- `content`: Short label (5-10 words). What is being done, not how.
- `details`: File paths, implementation steps, edge cases. Shown only when task is active.
- `notes`: Runtime observations added during execution.

<avoid>
- Single-step tasks — act directly
- Conversational or informational requests
- Tasks completable in under 3 trivial steps
</avoid>

<example name="start-task">
Mark task-2 in_progress before beginning work:
ops: [{op: "update", id: "task-2", status: "in_progress"}]
</example>

<example name="complete-and-advance">
Finish task-2 and start task-3 in one call:
ops: [
  {op: "update", id: "task-2", status: "completed"},
  {op: "update", id: "task-3", status: "in_progress"}
]
</example>

<example name="add_task">
Add a follow-up task with implementation specifics in `details`:
ops: [{op: "add_task", phase: "phase-2", content: "Handle retries", details: "Update retry.ts to cap exponential backoff and preserve AbortSignal handling"}]
</example>

<example name="initial-setup">
Replace is for setup only. Prefer add_phase / add_task for incremental additions.
ops: [{op: "replace", phases: [
  {name: "Investigation", tasks: [{content: "Read source"}, {content: "Map callsites"}]},
  {name: "Implementation", tasks: [{content: "Apply fix", details: "Update parser.ts to handle edge case in line 42"}, {content: "Run tests"}]}
]}]
</example>

<example name="skip">
User: "What does this function do?" / "Add a comment" / "Run npm install"
→ Do it directly. No list needed.
</example>
